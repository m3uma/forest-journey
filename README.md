## Description

The website design was created mainly to practice js and scss. The responsiveness of the website has been achieved mainly with the help of a grid, flex and media query.

The website includes:
* main slider made in js,
* dynamically generated offer in the table,
* photo gallery created using the swiper js API,
* contact form by which you can send an e-mail using the smtp protocol,
* section with general news about the company and links to social media.

On the "forest journey" page you can see the company's offer. At the top of the page there is a slider made in js - you can scroll it using the arrows on the screen, on the keyboard or select a slide by clicking the dot at the bottom.

Below is a section with the company's offer generated automatically. After clicking on a given adventure, its details are shown. To close them, press the cross in the upper right corner.

Then there is a photo gallery grouped by theme, made with the swiper js api. After opening a given folder, you can scroll through the shots using: arrows on the screen, on the keyboard, mouse scroll, and by dragging left or right. After clicking on a given photo, it is shown as fullscreen. To close the photo gallery, press the cross in the top right corner. 

Below is a contact form - after filling in all the required fields and pressing the "SEND A MESSAGE" button, the message will be sent. If the message has been delivered to the e-mail inbox, an alert appears in the application about its successful delivery.
